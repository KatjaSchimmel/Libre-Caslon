# Italic

It appears that some of the italic may have been created by half-rotating, half-slanting the romans.

Above, from left to right:

- the existing italic `g`
- a `g` rotated 15° and skewed 5°
- a `g` rotated 10° and skewed 10° (this one looks pretty close to the current real version)
- a `g` rotated 5° and skewed 15°
- a `g` skewed 20°

This approach could be a quick starting point for the Bold Italic. On the other hand, it might mean that we should throw out much of what currently exists for the regular Italic, in order to do it better…
