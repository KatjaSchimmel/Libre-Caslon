# Finding a "Regular" weight for Text Roman

### Current issue:

Libre Caslon Text "Regular" is significantly lighter in weight than comparable typefaces. It is also slightly lighter in appearance than Libre Caslon Text Italic (in part because the italic keeps roughly the same stroke width, but has a steep slope and slightly-narrow proportions).
