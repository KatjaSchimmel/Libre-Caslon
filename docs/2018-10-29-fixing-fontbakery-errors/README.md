# Fixing FontBakery Errors

I'll be logging my progress in getting through Failures & Errors caught by FontBakery on [this GitHub issue])(https://github.com/thundernixon/Libre-Caslon-Text/issues/2).

In this doc, I will go through setting up my `build.sh` script to handle Libre Caslon.

---

I'm using a `build.sh` set of scripts inherited from [@mjlagattuta](https://github.com/mjlagattuta), then customized and updated for [Encode Sans](https://github.com/thundernixon/Encode-Sans). This includes fixes for several of the problems that are flagged by FontBakery.
